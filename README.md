### [Power BI - 2017 Crime Statistics in Nigeria](https://github.com/AdeIkhmat/PowerBI-Projects/blob/4751d50ece6100a34915aae7903626322af1f70f/2017%20Crime%20Statistics%20In%20Nigeria.pbix)

This project is a visualization of the 2017 crime statistics in Nigeria. The data was obtained from the [National Bureau of Statistics](https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/).
The data was cleaned and transformed using Python and the final dataset was loaded into Power BI for visualization.
The project was completed in 2023.
